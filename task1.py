greeting: string that will contain a salutation, examples: Hello, Hiya, Ola
name: a string that will contain a person's name.  This should have a default value of "Benjamin"
question: a string that will contain a full question to ask the person.  It should have a default value of "How are you"

use the concatenate (+) operator. Make sure your spacing is appropriate.

return value:

assert sentence("Hello") == "Hello Benjamin. How are you"
assert sentence("Hiya","Casey","Have you enjoyed your meal") == "Hiya Casey. Have you enjoyed your meal"
